# FastFC
Fast Functional Connectivity Toolbox. This toolbox implements efficient C computing of different FC indices. It does so through C-MEX external interface appi and within Matlab's development environment.
#
Development branch for Phase Connectivity measures. 

This branch contains the source-code for implementation of PLV, PLI and wPLI measures. All in a single file in order to help ports to other toolboxes. Matlab's MEX external interface has been used to connect Matlab's environment variables to this C function.
