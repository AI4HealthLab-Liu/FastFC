# FastFC
Fast Functional Connectivity Toolbox. This toolbox implements efficient C computing of different FC indices. It does so through C-MEX external interface appi and within Matlab's development environment.
#
Development branch for Generalized Synchronization measures. 

S, H, M, L indices will be developed following descriptions from Daniel Chicharro's work (Chicharro et al 2009). 

S, H, M with a much faster and less memory demanding version (version2). It perfomrs this by avoiding andy sorting by using an ordered register filled online while measurements take place.

Maybe some other implementations will be added.
